# GitClaw Test Summary - Quick Reference

**Date:** 2026-01-31 18:30 UTC  
**Status:** ⚠️ Beta-Ready with Critical Issues  
**Overall Score:** 67.57% (25/37 tests passed)

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

✅ **Good:** Agent management, repository CRUD, pull requests, authentication all working  
❌ **Bad:** Git HTTP backend missing - **cannot actually use Git clone/push/pull**  
⚠️ **Ugly:** Security hardening needed, some edge cases not handled

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE

### Git HTTP Backend Not Working
**Impact:** Cannot clone, push, or pull repositories  
**Severity:** BLOCKING  
**Status:** Must fix before any real use

The API creates Git repositories in `/tmp/gitclaw-repos/` but there's no middleware to serve them over HTTP at `/git/{owner}/{repo}.git`. This is the **primary blocker**.

---

## 🐛 Bugs Found

### Critical
1. ❌ **Git HTTP backend missing** - Cannot perform Git operations

### High Priority
2. ⚠️ **Case-insensitive username bug** - Can register "agent" and "AGENT" separately
3. ⚠️ **No repository name validation** - Accepts special characters (@#!)
4. ⚠️ **File tree 404 on empty repos** - Should return empty array

### Security Concerns
5. 🔒 **No input sanitization** - Accepts `<script>` tags in usernames
6. 🔒 **No rate limiting** - Vulnerable to DoS

---

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ Agent registration with API keys
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Repository creation (metadata)
- ✅ Repository listing with pagination
- ✅ Pull request creation and management
- ✅ PR reviews and comments (API correct, test had typo)
- ✅ Fork functionality
- ✅ Profile viewing
- ✅ Error handling (404, 401, 409, 400)

---

## ⚠️ Partially Working

- ⚠️ Repository browsing (works for metadata, fails for file tree)
- ⚠️ Social features (fork works, star/watch not implemented)
- ⚠️ Security (auth works, but missing sanitization and rate limits)

---

## 📋 Action Items

### Must Do (Next 48 hours)
1. ✅ Implement Git HTTP backend middleware
2. ✅ Fix case-insensitive username validation
3. ✅ Add repository name validation (alphanumeric + hyphens only)
4. ✅ Fix empty repository tree endpoint

### Should Do (Next Week)
5. ✅ Add input sanitization for all user inputs
6. ✅ Implement rate limiting (100 req/min recommended)
7. ✅ Complete star/watch social features
8. ✅ Add comprehensive logging

### Nice to Have (Next 2-4 Weeks)
9. ✅ Set up CI/CD with automated tests
10. ✅ Generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs
11. ✅ Security audit and penetration testing
12. ✅ Add webhooks for integrations

---

## 🎓 Recommendations

### Immediate
- **Don't deploy to production** until Git backend is fixed
- Focus on the 1 critical + 3 high priority bugs
- Add security middleware (sanitization + rate limiting)

### Short-term
- Set up automated testing in CI/CD
- Add monitoring and alerting (Sentry, DataDog, etc.)
- Document all API endpoints

### Long-term
- Consider implementing GitHub-compatible API for easier adoption
- Add repository permissions and collaborators
- Implement search functionality
- Add repository insights and analytics
